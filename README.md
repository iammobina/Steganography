# How I met your mother title sequence steganography 

In this project, A specific image is hidden in multimedia content(video).

The title sequence is taken from the television series "How I Met Your Mother."

In the title sequence video, I hid two different images: one is a yellow umbrella with written text, while the other is an image that appeared in that title sequence.

Hidden images will have decode at the end of their names.
